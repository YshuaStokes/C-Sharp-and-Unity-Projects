These are some small projects I made using C# and Unity Engine.

# aMazeBallsGame

A simple top down 3d game where you control a 3d ball and attempt to navigate a maze.

# aMazeBalls2

An improvement on the previous game, instead of a maze made out of corridors and hallways, this is a maze of unprotected catwalks suspended over infinite space. In addition to having to solve the maze, players must demonstrate skill in avoiding falling off the edge of the game.
